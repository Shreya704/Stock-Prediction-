Overview
This project, conducted as part of my internship at Edureka, involved the analysis and prediction of stock prices for prominent tech companies, including Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. The primary focus was on data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization to derive meaningful insights.

Key Contributions
Data Analysis: Employed Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and PieChart to conduct a comprehensive analysis of stock data.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Applied robust techniques to clean and preprocess raw data from Google, Microsoft, and other sources, ensuring data integrity.

Visualization: Utilized visualizations to represent key trends and patterns in the stock data, facilitating a deeper understanding of the market dynamics.

Internship Experience: The project served as a valuable experience during my internship at Edureka, providing practical insights into real-world applications of data analysis in financial domains.

Repository Structure
Data: Contains both raw and processed datasets.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts used for analysis.
Images: Visualizations or charts generated from the data.
Source Code (src): Includes any code files used in the project.
